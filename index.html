          <h3>Increasing Rate of Sick Days at Work Since the Start of the Coffee Crisis</h3>

              In recent months, workplaces across the globe have reported a noticeable uptick in employee sick days—an unexpected consequence that experts are now linking to the ongoing coffee crisis. Once considered a minor inconvenience, the
              shortage of coffee beans and subsequent rise in prices have begun to show a surprising impact on workplace productivity and employee well-being. The so-called “coffee crisis” began as supply chains were disrupted by extreme weather
              conditions in key coffee-producing regions such as Brazil and Vietnam. Combined with logistical issues and rising global demand, the result has been a sharp increase in prices and a noticeable dip in availability—especially of quality,
              affordable coffee. While it may sound far-fetched, researchers and HR professionals are pointing to a potential connection between the reduced coffee intake and an increase in reported illnesses or unplanned absences. “Caffeine has long
              been a part of many workers’ daily routines—not just as a stimulant but as a ritual that helps signal the start of the workday,” said Dr. Lena Ortiz, a behavioral psychologist at the Workplace Wellness Institute. “When that routine is
              disrupted, we’re seeing signs of fatigue, irritability, and even increased stress levels, which can contribute to both mental and physical health issues.” Some companies have already begun to take notice. A recent internal report from a
              major tech firm revealed that sick leave requests have increased by nearly 15% since January, coinciding with the period when office coffee supplies dwindled and costs rose. While it's difficult to draw a direct causal link, employee
              feedback surveys frequently cite “lack of caffeine” and “low energy” as common complaints. The crisis has also sparked creative responses from employers. Some have started offering alternative energy-boosting options such as matcha,
              herbal teas, or even short in-office meditation breaks. Others have invested in better wellness programs to support employees navigating a coffee-light workday. Though the idea of coffee affecting public health may once have seemed
              laughable, the ripple effect of its absence is now very real for many modern workplaces. Whether the trend of rising sick days continues will likely depend on how long the coffee crisis lasts—and how well employers and employees adapt
              to a caffeine-reduced world.
